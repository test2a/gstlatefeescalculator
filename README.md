Excel sheet for late fees for filing returns after due date

This sheet simply calculates the total late fees you are liable to pay if you have yet to file your return since your registration.

If you are liable for GST after July, say you registered in the month of December and have yet to file your return, simply delete the “Due Date” and “current Date” for that corresponding month and it will give you the correct late fees.

If you have some returns as Nil and some with data, then follow the above process for the months in the relevant sheet and simply delete the unnecessary data. You do not want to calculate both regular as well as nil for the same month. Please use only one for each month
